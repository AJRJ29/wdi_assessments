# Project Assessments

In Seattle, we do an assessment after project 1 but haven't had much need to do any others because the projects themselves are required to be passing and are held to a pretty high bar. We also mostly have shed anyone who's not going to make it through the program by the time unit 2 sets in, so using 3 hours of class time for an assessment seemed wasteful beyond unit 1.
