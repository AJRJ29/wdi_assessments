## Welcome to General Assembly WDI

Fear not! These assessments aren't meant to be tricky - they're just here to make sure you understood most of what we covered for each lesson and 
project week! Furthermore, you can consider the weekly assessments effectively a review guide of the basic concepts we learned that week in class.
