b) An in-place sort (or a version exists that is)
c) Has a best case time complexity of Ω(N)

#### 3. Other than being super fun, the Quick Sort algorithm is: (Circle all that apply - 6 points)

```
a) One of the fastest sorting algorithms on unrestricted input
b) An in-place sort (or a version exists that is)
c) Has a best case time complexity of Ω(N)
d) A distribution sort
e) A stable sort
f) Has a worst case time complexity of O(N^2)
```

#### 4. An "in-place sort" and a sort with a "space complexity of O(1)" are both ways of expressing: (1 point)

```
a) The sort uses no memory at all
b) The sort uses a single bit of memory
c) The sort does not need extra memory based on the size of the input
d) The sort does not move any elements because they are already in order
e) This sentence means nothing, we just say it to impress the boss
```
