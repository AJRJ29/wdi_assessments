#### 1. What does MVC stand for? (Choose one - 1 point)

```
a) mustaches, vests, coffee			b) model, viewport, change
c) modals, views, controls  			d) model, view, controller
e) movies, video games, cheetos			f) master, version control
```

#### 2. Other than being great to pull out at parties, the Bubble Sort algorithm is: (Circle all that apply - 6 points)

```
a) One of the fastest sorting algorithms on unrestricted input
b) An in-place sort (or a version exists that is)
c) Has a best case time complexity of Ω(N)
d) A distribution sort
e) A stable sort
f) Has a worst case time complexity of O(N^2)
```

#### 3. Other than being super fun, the Quick Sort algorithm is: (Circle all that apply - 6 points)

```
a) One of the fastest sorting algorithms on unrestricted input
b) An in-place sort (or a version exists that is)
c) Has a best case time complexity of Ω(N)
d) A distribution sort
e) A stable sort
f) Has a worst case time complexity of O(N^2)
```

#### 4. An "in-place sort" and a sort with a "space complexity of O(1)" are both ways of expressing: (1 point)

```
a) The sort does not need extra memory based on the size of the input
b) The sort uses no memory at all
c) The sort uses a single bit of memory
d) The sort does not move any elements because they are already in order
e) This sentence means nothing, we just say it to impress the boss
```

#### 5. Draw a line to match the item on the left with its definition on the right: (3 points)

```
Big O					Best case
Big Ω (omega)			Average case
Big Θ (theta)			Worst Case
```

#### 6. Which of the following are one of the 4 priciples of object-oriented programming? (Circle exactly 4: 4 points)

```
a) Abstraction		
b) Association
c) Automation
d) Capitulation	
e) Deprecation
f) Encryption
g) Encapsulation
h) Polyhedrons
i) Polymorphism
j) Polymerization
k) Inheritance
l) Instantiation
m) Recursion
n) Optimization
o) Continuous Integration
p) Merging
q) Ambiguity
```
