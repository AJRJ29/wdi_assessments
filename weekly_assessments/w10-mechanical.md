# Week 10 Mechanical - NAME: ___________ `__/6` 

### All questions pertain to the Python language

##### Q1) Assign a dictionary containing two key/value pairs of your choosing to a variable named 'items':
<br>


##### Q2) Define a function named `add_numbers` that has two parameters and, when invoked, would **return** the sum of the two arguments.  For example: `add_numbers(5, 10)` would return `15`:
<br><br><br><br><br>

```python
cats = 2
dogs = 4
```
###### Assuming the above code...

##### Q3) Using string formatting, "insert" the value of the variables `cats` and `dogs` in place of "_x_" and "_y_", to assign the string "**_There are x cats and y dogs_**" to a variable named `pet_msg`:
<br>

##### Q4) Define a function named `more_cats_or_dogs`, that if invoked like this:<br> `more_cats_or_dogs(cats, dogs)`<br>would return "cats" or "dogs" (strings) depending upon the larger of the two values being passed in for the `cats` and `dogs` arguments (no need to worry about the values for `cats` and `dogs` being equal):
<br><br><br><br><br>

```python
class Cat:











```

##### Q5) Within the class `Cat` above, write an `__init__` dunder method with two parameters: `name` & `age`; that are used to create two instance variables (attributes).

##### Q6) Create an object using the `Cat` class above having a _name_ and _age_ of your choosing.  Assign the new instance to a variable named `my_cat`:
