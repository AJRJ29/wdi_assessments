1. What prints out from the console.log statement? (1 point)

* a) Undefined
* b) Null
* c) Empty String
* d) 6
* e) None; it throws an error

2. There is no return statement in the function. That is...? (1 point)

* a) Fine. It will figure out to return `a * b`
* b) Not fine. It will throw an error
* c) Fine. It returns the `this` object by default
* d) Not fine. There's no error but it just returns `undefined`
* e) None of the above

4. Async and Await in ES6+ offer...? (1 point)

* a) A way to wait for an asynchronous call to finish without a bunch of callbacks
* b) A way of performing a loop operation in the background

<br><br>

5. The difference between `var` and `let` is what? (1 point)

* a) var means `variable` and let means `lettuce code`
* b) let is more specifically scoped than var
* c) var is more specifically scoped than let
* d) let eliminates the need for callback functions
* e) Only var allows you to use jQuery

<br>

#### Consider the following code

```javascript
for(var i = 0; i < 5; i++){
    console.log('hello from i', i);
}

for(let j = 0; j < 5; j++){
    console.log('hello from j', j);
}

console.log(i);
console.log(j);
```

<br>

6. At the end of running this code, the value of `i` is what? (1 point)

* a) 0
* b) 4
* c) 5
* d) undefined
* e) None of the above

<br><br>

7. At the end of running this code, the value of `j` is what? (1 point)

* a) 0

* c) You can't change it, but if it's an object you can change its properties
* d) You can't change it, not even a little
* e) None of the above

<br><br>

10. What is the new operator ... (the 3 dots)? (1 point)

* a) Spread operator
* b) Axios operator
* c) Mutator operator
* d) It's not an operator, it's a shortcut for RESTful routing
* e) None of the above

<br>

#### Consider the following ES6 Code

```javascript
var foo = ['one', 'two', 'three'];

var [one, two, three] = foo;
console.log(one); // "one"
console.log(two); // "two"
console.log(three); // "three"
```

<br><br>

11. This is an example of...? (1 point)

* a) Array/Object Destructuring
