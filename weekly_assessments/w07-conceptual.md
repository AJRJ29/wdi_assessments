## JavaScript - ES6

Consider the following code

```javascript
const myFn = (a, b) => { a * b }

console.log(myFn(2, 3))
```

<br><br>

1. What prints out from the console.log statement? (1 point)

* a) Undefined
* b) Null
* c) Empty String
* d) 6
* e) None; it throws an error 

<br><br>

2. There is no return statement in the function. That is...? (1 point)

* a) Fine. It will figure out to return `a * b`
* b) Not fine. It will throw an error
* c) Fine. It returns the `this` object by default
* d) Not fine. There's no error but it just returns `undefined`
* e) None of the above

<br><br>

3. Which of the following is a feature of arrow functions? (1 point)

* a) Difficult to read code
* b) Integrated objective properties
* c) The `this` object is scoped to the parent
* d) The `this` object is `undefined`
* e) None of the above

<br><br>

4. Async and Await in ES6+ offer...? (1 point)

* a) A way to wait for an asynchronous call to finish without a bunch of callbacks
* b) A way of performing a loop operation in the background
* c) A way to bind data to the `this` object
* d) A way of handling exceptions gracefully in your code
* e) None of the above
